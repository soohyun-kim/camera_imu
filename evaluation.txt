This project is being deprecated, for reasons of insufficient performance and
the need for additional components.

First, an evaluation on the components used.  The gyroscope module from
Adafruit was purchased under the erronous belief that it was sufficiently
precise for vfx work, as in perfect camera alignment could be achieved
real-time vs virtual.  This did not prove to be the case; large deviation was
observed between the real and recorded motion, requiring heavy correction in
post-production.  After correction, the footage worked well, but the process
is deemed too cumbersome to use in any practical purpose.

It should be made clear that the rest of the items and processes surrounding
the gyroscope worked perfectly, primarily, the recording of integrated camera
position in euler angles to SD card, triggered by simultaneous record start
between camera and Teensy.

The large error in recording has led to abandoning the idea of recording human motion via
gyroscope.  Rather, it is now prospective to produce highly precise,
controlled motion in the first place through
motorized devices, which will be easier to process.  This, in turn, will
require additional expense; a motorized slider and head will be necessary.

Additionally, there is a need to add additional components.  The RCA jack was
added and "broken out" onto the PCB to allow wireless analog video
transmission, but the need to provide power for such a device was not
addressed.  The next iteration of camera control will incorporate such needs.

Finally, the board requires more robust control over the camera than what is
currently provided: only record start/stop.  Additional functions including,
ISO control, focus control, iris control, etc. will all be necessary.
